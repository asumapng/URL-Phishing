# URL Phishing Detection using AI/ML Techniques



I am Suma. A data science and analytics student pursuing her final year of Bachelor's in Vocation course. This website is my final semester project. The objectives of the project are building a URL phishing detector tool using AI/ML Techniques and creating a web application for public use.

The model built is a random forest model. It provided an accuracy of 96% on the test data. It was highest compared to 8 other models that were built and compared. 
Streamlit is used for web application development.


Use the web application:
